A offline nonlinear trajectory planning approach utilizing [TOWR](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr) for our quadruped Pholus was implemented. The trajectory for four end-effectors are calculated and simulated with Gazebo. We are using single rigid body dynamics for the dynamic model and a cartesian space kinematic model bouding the motion of the end effectors.
