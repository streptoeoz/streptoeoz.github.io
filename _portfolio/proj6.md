We reimplemented [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf) for object classification with our own modifications. The results are evaluated utilizing [ModeNet40](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf). <br>

Modifications involve incorporating spatial transform networks to align the data, adding normal channels and including farthest point sample layer for better representation of geometric data.
