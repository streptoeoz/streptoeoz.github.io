An invariant EKF is implemented for a quadruped in Matlab and C++. We used self-generated fake data and [Zurich Urban Aerial Vehicle Dataset](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/zurichmavdataset.html) to verify our filter. For more details, please refer to the report in our [github page](https://github.com/ghaggin/invariant-ekf).
